# filereader

Simple application that can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on text files.

### Things to note

Only performs CRUD on the current directory it is in.
To do:
- Optimise current code to list available files in the current directory.
- Select file to edit based on current index in a list rather than typing out the filename for greater ease
- Intend to convert text program to GUI.
